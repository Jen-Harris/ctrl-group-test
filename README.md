# Ctrl Group Challenge 

## What
A prototype of a one page app to allow clinicians to view their patients progress on certain treatments over an extended period of time. 

## How 
I list is detail the process I took below, however here a few more general comments about my thought process first: 
* I wanted keep the designs of the graphs similar to that of the PDF so that it would remain consistent  for the clinician _*(plus I couldn't think of a better way of showing the data!)*_
    * I also saw this as an opportunity to try and style to graphs from scratch using chart.js which would allow flexibility in design and the data inputted 
* I decided that it felt like there was a lot of information on the PDF that once a clinician has seen it once they will no longer require. Therefore I included a _*'show more'*_ drop down to keep the design uncluttered and allow more space for the data to be displayed. 
    * This also led to the idea of having an overview section at the beginning that could summarize the data without having to review the charts
* After researching Sass (following the initial interview) I made the decision that it wasn't the right framework for this project as the key advantages to Sass only become apparent in larger projects.
* It was important to me for the design to be simple and uncluttered so that the data was the main focus of the page

## Blue Sky :rainbow:
If I had more time I would have focused on:
- [ ] Responsiveness of the app 
- [ ] The drop down information 
- [ ] Including more Graphs 
- [ ] Linking top boxes to more detailed section
- [ ] Automate the data from the JSON to the graph
